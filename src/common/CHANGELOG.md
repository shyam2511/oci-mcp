# Changelog

All notable changes to `oracle-mcp-common` are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Runtime package metadata now reads the installed distribution version, with
  `pyproject.toml` as the single source of truth.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- Added RPv2.1.2 authentication with refreshed time-bound security contexts and realm-aware bootstrap endpoints.

## 0.1.3

### Changed

- Excluded development artifacts and local configuration from the shared library’s source distribution.

## 0.1.2

### Fixed

- Session-token authentication now requires only `key_file` and
  `security_token_file`, allowing profiles created by `oci session authenticate`
  to work without API-key-only fields such as `user`, `fingerprint`, or
  `tenancy`. ([#400](https://github.com/oracle/mcp/issues/400))

## 0.1.1

### Added

- Exported authentication type, config file, and profile resolution helpers for
  consumers that need the same credential-selection behavior without
  constructing an OCI SDK signer.

## 0.1.0

### Added

- Introduced shared OCI SDK authentication contexts for API keys, session
  tokens, Identity Domains UPST exchange, instance and resource principals,
  delegation tokens, and OKE workload identity.
- Added HTTP OCI IAM/IDCS provider setup and caller-specific request-token
  exchange for authenticated MCP servers.
- Added inheritance-safe OCI profile classification for session-token
  authentication.
