# MCP Server Best Practices

This document lays out the best practices for an individual MCP server. You may use `oci-compute-mcp-server` as an example.

## Code Organization

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - `models.py`: Define data models and validation logic
   - `server.py`: Implement MCP server, tools, and resources
   - `consts.py`: Define constants used across the server
   - Additional modules for specific functionality (e.g., API clients)

2. **Keep modules focused and limited to a single responsibility**

3. **Use clear and consistent naming conventions**

### Entry Points

MCP servers should follow these guidelines for application entry points:

1. **Single Entry Point**: Define the main entry point only in `server.py`
   - Do not create a separate `main.py` file
   - This maintains clarity about how the application starts

2. **Main Function**: Implement a `main()` function in `server.py` that:
   - Handles command-line arguments
   - Sets up environment and logging
   - Initializes the MCP server

Example:

```python
def main():
    """Run the MCP server with CLI argument support."""
    mcp.run()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

3. **Package Entry Point**: Configure the entry point in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.scripts]
"oracle.mcp-server-name" = "oracle.mcp_server_name.server:main"
```

## OCI SDK user-agent telemetry

Every server that constructs OCI Python SDK clients must attach a consistent additional user agent to every client configuration path. Derive it from package metadata rather than duplicating a server name or version literal:

```python
# oracle/mcp_server_name/__init__.py
from importlib.metadata import version as distribution_version

__project__ = "oracle.mcp-server-name"
__version__ = distribution_version(__project__)
```

Keep the distribution version only in `pyproject.toml`. Do not add a
`PackageNotFoundError` fallback: importing a package that is not installed in
the active environment should fail instead of exposing stale metadata.

```python
# oracle/mcp_server_name/server.py
from . import __project__, __version__

_user_agent_name = __project__.split("oracle.", 1)[1].split("-server", 1)[0]
_ADDITIONAL_UA = f"{_user_agent_name}/{__version__}"
```

Set the derived value before constructing every OCI SDK client, including API-key, security-token, each supported principal-based path (for example, instance- and resource-principal), and HTTP/token-exchange paths when the server supports them:

```python
config["additional_user_agent"] = _ADDITIONAL_UA
client = oci.some_service.SomeClient(config)
```

Client factories and authentication helpers may live outside `server.py`; the requirement is that every OCI client-construction path receives `_ADDITIONAL_UA`. Unit tests must assert the exact derived value passed through each supported path.

`oci-api-mcp-server` is the exception: it launches the OCI CLI rather than constructing OCI Python SDK clients directly. Set the same derived value on the subprocess environment instead:

```python
env_copy["OCI_SDK_APPEND_USER_AGENT"] = _ADDITIONAL_UA
```

Note: always remove `-server` from the end of the `__project__` name; ex `oci-cloud-mcp`.

## OCI SDK authentication

Python MCP servers that construct OCI SDK clients should use the shared
`oracle-mcp-common` package instead of duplicating credential resolution,
profile parsing, environment-variable precedence, or signer construction.
Declare a bounded dependency compatible with the shared library's public API:

```toml
dependencies = [
    "oracle-mcp-common>=0.2.0,<0.3.0",
]
```

Use `build_auth_context()` from `oracle_mcp_common` to obtain the selected
authentication type, SDK config, and signer. The server remains responsible
for its OCI client type, retry and circuit-breaker policy, derived additional
user agent, and client lifecycle:

```python
import oci

from oracle_mcp_common import build_auth_context

auth_context = build_auth_context()
config = {
    **auth_context.config,
    "additional_user_agent": _ADDITIONAL_UA,
}
client = oci.object_storage.ObjectStorageClient(
    config,
    signer=auth_context.signer,
)
```

The module supports API-key, security-token, identity-domain UPST,
instance/resource principal, delegation, and OKE workload-identity flows.
Use `AuthOptions` only when the server needs to explicitly override its
configured authentication inputs. Unit tests must cover every supported
client-construction authentication path and assert the exact additional user
agent passed to the OCI SDK.

### HTTP IDCS request-token authentication

For an HTTP server that authenticates callers through OCI IAM/IDCS and signs
OCI SDK requests as the authenticated caller, use the shared HTTP policy
instead of duplicating `OCIProvider` and `TokenExchangeSigner` setup:

```python
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_access_token

from oracle_mcp_common import build_idcs_http_auth

# Startup: the server retains the mcp.auth assignment and HTTP listener setup.
http_auth = build_idcs_http_auth(required_scopes)
mcp.auth = http_auth.provider

# Request handling: retrieve the validated token in the server, then exchange it.
access_token = get_access_token()
request_auth = http_auth.context_for(access_token.token)
config = {**request_auth.config, "additional_user_agent": _ADDITIONAL_UA}
client = oci.object_storage.ObjectStorageClient(config, signer=request_auth.signer)
```

`build_idcs_http_auth()` validates `IDCS_DOMAIN`, `IDCS_CLIENT_ID`,
`IDCS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `IDCS_AUDIENCE`, and `ORACLE_MCP_BASE_URL`; `context_for()`
requires an authenticated access token and a region from an explicit argument
or `OCI_REGION`. The common package must not inspect host/port, start a
listener, assign `mcp.auth`, retrieve request context, create a service client,
or set `additional_user_agent`.

Each HTTP signer and OCI client is caller-specific. Do not cache either
globally or reuse it across requests from different callers. Tests must cover
successful provider setup and token exchange, failures before provider/signer
construction for missing or malformed configuration, secret-safe errors, the
exact derived user agent, and caller-specific client behavior.

## Type Definitions

### General Rules

1. Make all models Pydantic; this ensures serializability. You may refer to the OCI python SDK for reference to most OCI models.
2. Define Literals for constrained values.
3. Add comprehensive descriptions to each field.

Pydantic model example for [NetworkSecurityGroup](src/oci-networking-mcp-server/oracle/oci_networking_mcp_server/models.py)

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Literal, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class NetworkSecurityGroup(BaseModel):
    """
    Pydantic model mirroring the fields of oci.core.models.NetworkSecurityGroup.
    """

    compartment_id: Optional[str] = Field(
        None,
        description="The OCID of the compartment containing the network security group.",
    )
    defined_tags: Optional[Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]] = Field(
        None,
        description="Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace.",
    )
    display_name: Optional[str] = Field(
        None, description="A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique."
    )
    freeform_tags: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = Field(
        None, description="Free-form tags for this resource as simple key/value pairs."
    )
    id: Optional[str] = Field(
        None, description="The OCID of the network security group."
    )
    lifecycle_state: Optional[
        Literal[
            "PROVISIONING",
            "AVAILABLE",
            "TERMINATING",
            "TERMINATED",
            "UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUE",
        ]
    ] = Field(None, description="The network security group's current state.")
    time_created: Optional[datetime] = Field(
        None,
        description="The date and time the network security group was created (RFC3339).",
    )
    vcn_id: Optional[str] = Field(
        None, description="The OCID of the VCN the network security group belongs to."
    )
```

The pydantic model above was generated using Cline by providing it a prompt similar to this:
```
Can you create a pydantic model of oci.core.models.NetworkSecurityGroup and put it inside of the oracle/oci_networking_mcp_server/models.py file, and name it NetworkSecurityGroup? Can you also make a function that maps an oci.core.models.NetworkSecurityGroup instance to an oracle.oci_networking_mcp_server.model.NetworkSecurityGroup instance? Do the same for all of the nested types within the model as well

Use file oracle/oci_compute_mcp_server/models.py as an example of how to do this
```

## Function Parameters with Pydantic Field

MCP tool functions should use spread parameters with Pydantic's `Field` for detailed descriptions:

Here is an example for [list_instances](src/oci-compute-mcp-server/oracle/oci_compute_mcp_server/server.py)

```python
@mcp.tool(description="List Instances in a given compartment")
def list_instances(
    compartment_id: str = Field(..., description="The OCID of the compartment"),
    limit: Optional[int] = Field(
        None,
        description="The maximum amount of instances to return. If None, there is no limit.",
        ge=1,
    ),
    lifecycle_state: Optional[
        Literal[
            "MOVING",
            "PROVISIONING",
            "RUNNING",
            "STARTING",
            "STOPPING",
            "STOPPED",
            "CREATING_IMAGE",
            "TERMINATING",
            "TERMINATED",
        ]
    ] = Field(None, description="The lifecycle state of the instance to filter on"),
) -> list[Instance]:
    instances: list[Instance] = []

    try:
        client = get_compute_client()

        response: oci.response.Response = None
        has_next_page = True
        next_page: str = None

        while has_next_page and (limit is None or len(instances) < limit):
            kwargs = {
                "compartment_id": compartment_id,
                "page": next_page,
                "limit": limit,
            }

            if lifecycle_state is not None:
                kwargs["lifecycle_state"] = lifecycle_state

            response = client.list_instances(**kwargs)
            has_next_page = response.has_next_page
            next_page = response.next_page if hasattr(response, "next_page") else None

            data: list[oci.core.models.Instance] = response.data
            for d in data:
                instance = map_instance(d)
                instances.append(instance)

        logger.info(f"Found {len(instances)} Instances")
        return instances

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in list_instances tool: {str(e)}")
        raise e
```

### Field Guidelines

1. **Required parameters**: Use `...` as the default value to indicate a parameter is required
2. **Optional parameters**: Provide sensible defaults and mark as `Optional` in the type hint
3. **Descriptions**: Write clear, informative descriptions for each parameter
4. **Validation**: Use Field constraints like `ge`, `le`, `min_length`, `max_length`
5. **Literals**: Use `Literal` for parameters with a fixed set of valid values

## Test cases

Target 90% coverage for unit tests on the MCP server itself.

End-to-end tests under `e2e/` are not required, but good to add if they can be created without impacting other tests.
